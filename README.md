frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================



This is one of the projects in Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program. is a simple version of an arcade game written in JavaScript. 

Details of the project can be found in this [guide][1].

The basic game engine and graphics were supplied by Udacity. 
Game additional features such as score and levels were developed by me.

This repository was cloned from this Udacity [repository][2].
So you can check the starting code.

## How to play the game
* In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs).
* The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies,
And to successfully move to the next level.
* The player can move left, right, up and down.
* The enemies move in varying speeds, each level the speeds and the number of enemies increment.
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the player moves back to the start square. 
* Once the player reaches the water, the player scores an additional point.


## Extra features
In going beyond the [instructions][1] I added the following features:

* multiple levels, with each level containing extra speeder enemies.
* a game's score that gets higher everytime the player reaches the water.
